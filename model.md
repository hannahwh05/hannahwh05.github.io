#### Model Concept: :sheep: :herb: 

The idea of this model is to imagine that the agents are like sheep. These sheep walk around the environment randomly and graze as if it is grass, adding to their "stores".

#### Model Notes:

* The environment is altered by the agents as they eat their way around.
* The agents know that they are not alone in the model and can interact and share their food stores.
* If an agent is in the way of another, it will move around the environment, and not on top of the other agent.
* Each agent has a data store capacity of 1000, if it consumes any more data it will vomit, depositing all of its data stores.
* The behaviours of each agent in their environment can be viewed as an animation. Once some grass is consumed by an agent, the environment patch will change colour and will have a decreased store.
