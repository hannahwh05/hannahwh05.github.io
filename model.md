## The Model
---

#### Model Concept: :sheep: :herb: 

The idea of this model is to imagine that the agents are like sheep. These sheep walk around the environment randomly and graze as if it is grass, adding to their "stores".

#### Model Documentation:

* As the agents eat their way around, the environment is altered.
* The agents know that they are not alone in the model and can interact and share their food stores.
* Each agent has a data store capacity of 255, if it consumes any more data it will vomit and deposit 255 of its data stores.
* The behaviours of each agent in their environment can be viewed as an animation. Once some grass is consumed by an agent, the environment patch will change colour and will have a decreased store.
* To run the model, click "Run" from the dropdown Menu:

<br/>

* The animation will then run until the stopping condition is met.
