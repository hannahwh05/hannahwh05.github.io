## Assessment 2: Independent Project - Planning for drunks - Show me the way to go home...
---

Version 1.0.0

DrunkModel.py and drunkframework.py was developed for Assessment 2 of GEOG5990M Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills. 

The model simulates a town of 25 drunk people trying to “stumble” back to their homes from the pub. It outputs a density map and .txt file to show where drunks stumbled on their way back to their homes. 

It was developed in Spyder 3.3.2 (Python 3.7) and the following documentation describes how to run it from this IDE. 

There are no further plans for development of this program.
