5.	Potential Additions to the Model

To improve the model, a custom colormap could be created to form discrete colours for each value within the environment, as currently the pub cannot be seen within the simulation as it is equal to 0. The colours of the drunks could also match the colours of their houses. Ideally the density map would be overlaid on top of the animation if 0 in the environment was transparent.   
Additionally, distractions could be added along the way, e.g. a chip van, so they wander off course and donâ€™t head straight home.  Pathways could be added so the drunks have to walk in certain ways. 
Finally, the code could be further optimised to improve run time, for instance, by only calculating distances for moves that are actually made rather than for all potential moves. However, the length of run time has not been an issue at present.
