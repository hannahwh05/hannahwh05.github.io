#### Assessment Outline:

As part of my MSc Geographical Information Systems at  University of Leeds, I am required to produce an online portfolio of my practical work. This module has taught me basic Python and some useful elements of core programming culture, including GitHub.

For a formal module description follow this link: http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?F=P&M=GEOG-5990M

On this website you will find links to my [repository](https://github.com/hannahwh05/GEOG5990M_Programming), which includes code for the [final agent based model](https://github.com/hannahwh05/GEOG5990M_Programming/tree/master/ABM_Final) , [documentation](https://github.com/hannahwh05/GEOG5990M_Programming/blob/master/README.md) as well as directories for [Practicals 1-9:] (outlined below), for each weeks code. 

#### Model Concept: 

The idea of this model is to imagine that the agents are like sheep. These sheep walk around the environment randomly and graze as if it is grass, adding to their "stores".

#### Model Notes:

* The environment is altered by the agents as they eat their way around.
* The agents know that they are not alone in the model and can interact and share their food stores.
* If an agent is in the way of another, it will move around the environment, and not on top of the other agent.
* Each agent has a data store capacity of 1000, if it consumes any more data it will vomit, depositing all of its data stores.
* The behaviours of each agent in their environment can be viewed as an animation. Once some grass is consumed by an agent, the environment patch will change colour and will have a decreased store.

#### The Model: 

You can access the final code and further information about the project on my GitHub repository.
